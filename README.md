# Lummet Control Plane

Standalone Cloudflare Worker + D1 database. This is a **separate
project from any tenant repo** — it never shares code or a database
with tenant deployments, and tenants never need to redeploy or
migrate anything for this to exist.

It talks to tenants only over HTTPS, via each tenant's
`/en/api/super/*` Super API (see the tenant repo's
`en/docs/super-api.md`). It never queries a tenant's D1 directly.

**For deployment steps, see `DEPLOYMENT.md`** in this folder — it
covers both halves (this control plane and the tenant-side Super
API) end-to-end, plus day-to-day operation and rollback.

## What's in Phase 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8

- `migrations/0001_control_plane.sql` — tenant registry, encrypted
  credential storage, capability/health cache, and a completely
  separate Lummet admin identity system (`lummet_admins`,
  `lummet_sessions`) with its own audit log.
- `worker/crypto.js` — AES-GCM encrypt/decrypt for tenant HMAC
  secrets at rest, keyed by a Worker secret (`CREDENTIAL_KEK`) that
  never touches D1.
- `worker/signing.js` — builds the same HMAC-signed headers the
  tenant's Super API verifies (shared canonical-string scheme).
- `worker/data.js` — shared low-level D1 reads (tenant rows, active
  credential) used by both `registry.js` and `client.js`.
- `worker/client.js` — the single place this control plane ever
  makes an outbound HTTPS call to a tenant. Exposes
  `requestTenant(env, tenant, { method, path, body, timeoutMs })`,
  handles credential lookup/decryption + signing, and normalizes
  every failure into the error taxonomy from rule #24 (401/403/404/
  409/422/429/500/502/504), distinguishing a genuine timeout (504)
  from a network/connection failure (502).
- `worker/auth.js` — Lummet master-admin login/session (PBKDF2 +
  HttpOnly session cookie), bootstrap-first-admin flow, rate
  limiting.
- `worker/registry.js` — tenant CRUD, credential issuance/rotation,
  and connection testing. `testConnection()` routes through
  `client.js`'s `requestTenant()` rather than constructing its own
  `fetch()`.
- `worker/audit.js` — control-plane-side audit log writer.
- `worker/views/layout.js` — shared HTML shell (sidebar nav,
  topbar, CSS) — its own visual identity, deliberately distinct
  from the tenant admin UI (rule #11).
- `worker/views/pages/login.js` — login page, which automatically
  switches to a one-time "create the first admin" form when
  `lummet_admins` is empty.
- `worker/views/pages/dashboard.js` — overview page: tenant counts,
  health breakdown, recent audit activity.
- `worker/views/pages/tenants.js` — All Tenants, Add Tenant
  (shows the issued credential exactly once), Health, Deployments,
  and per-tenant detail (enable/disable/rotate/test/delete actions).
- `worker/views/pages/platform.js` — Audit Logs, Credentials, and
  Capabilities pages (all backed by local control-plane data), plus
  a static API reference page.
- `worker/views/pages/placeholder.js` — Content/System nav sections
  render with the correct navigation and labels now, but explain
  that managing tenant resources requires tenant switching (Phase 5)
  and the resource CRUD screens (Phase 6).
- `worker/index.js` — now serves both the JSON API (unchanged) and
  the HTML dashboard pages. Page routes redirect an unauthenticated
  visitor to `/login`; API routes still return a JSON 401.

The dashboard's navigation follows the exact structure from the
master plan's rule #11 (Dashboard / Tenants / Content / System /
Platform), but its look is its own — a dark, mission-control style
distinct from the tenant CMS admin, so an operator can never mistake
one for the other.

Not yet built (later phases): tenant-switching-aware CRUD screens
for Content/System (Phase 6), the health-check cron (Phase 7). Both
are documented further down — see those sections below.

### Phase 5 — Tenant switching

- The topbar on every dashboard page now shows an **active tenant**
  selector, populated from the registry. Switching tenants calls
  `POST /api/tenants/:id/switch` (or `DELETE /api/session/active-tenant`
  to clear it), which only ever updates `lummet_sessions.active_tenant_id`
  — the tenant's own session/auth state is never touched (rule #12).
- A tenant's detail page also offers a "Set as active tenant" button,
  and shows an "Active tenant" badge when it's the current selection.
- The Content/System placeholder pages now reflect which tenant (if
  any) is active, previewing what Phase 6's CRUD screens will operate
  against once they resolve requests through `client.js`'s
  `requestTenant()` against `admin.activeTenantId`.
- Every switch/clear action is recorded in `lummet_audit_logs`
  (`action: "switch_tenant"` / `"clear_active_tenant"`).

### Phase 6 — CRUD administration

- `worker/resources.js` — field/column configuration for every
  resource the tenant's Super API supports, taken directly from the
  tenant repo's actual `schema.sql` columns and the real Phase 1
  handler signatures (which key differ per resource: `casinos`,
  `reviews`, `news`, `pages`, `categories` on `:slug`; `countries` on
  `:code`; `authors`, `media`, `users` on numeric `:id`).
- `worker/views/pages/crud.js` — generic list/create/edit screens
  driven entirely by that config. Every read and write goes through
  `client.js`'s `requestTenant()` (via `getFromTenant`/`postToTenant`/
  `putToTenant`/`deleteFromTenant`) against `admin.activeTenantId` —
  no page ever constructs its own `fetch()`.
- `worker/views/pages/settings.js` — a dedicated screen for
  `settings`, since it's a key/value dictionary rather than a list of
  records; existing keys are editable in place and a new key can be
  added, all through the same safe-settings filter the tenant's
  Super API already enforces.
- **Capability-aware**: a list screen checks the tenant's cached
  `tenant_capabilities` (from a prior "Test connection") and shows a
  clear notice instead of a broken screen if that tenant's deployment
  reports the resource as unsupported (rule #16).
- **No active tenant**: every CRUD/settings screen shows a plain
  "select a tenant" notice rather than erroring if nothing is active.
- **Errors**: any non-2xx from the tenant is shown inline using the
  taxonomy from `client.js` (401/403/404/409/422/429/500/502/504),
  never a raw stack trace (rule #24).
- **Unsupported nav items stay honest**: `permissions` and
  `components` remain on the System nav (per the master plan's fixed
  nav structure) but still render the Phase 4 placeholder, since no
  Super API endpoint exists for them yet — they were never part of
  Phase 1's allowlist.
- **users** is role-only (no create/delete) and **media** is
  edit/delete-only (no create — there's no upload endpoint in the
  Super API yet), matching exactly what Phase 1's handlers actually
  expose.
- While wiring `authors` into the CRUD config, found and fixed a
  real bug in the tenant repo's Phase 1 `super/handlers.js`:
  `handleGetAuthor` was keying on `slug` while `handleUpdateAuthor`/
  `handleDeleteAuthor` key on numeric `id`, even though all three
  share the same `:id` URL segment from `router.js`. Fixed to use
  `authorsDB.getAuthorById()` consistently. See the tenant repo's
  updated `en/worker/super/handlers.js`.

### Phase 7 — Health monitoring cron

- `worker/cron.js` — `runHealthChecks(env)` walks every registered
  tenant (active and disabled) in small concurrent batches (default
  5 at a time) and calls `registry.js`'s `testConnection()` for
  each — the exact same code path a manual "Test connection" click
  uses, which itself routes through `client.js` (rule #23). A
  network failure, timeout, or disabled tenant is recorded with its
  correct status in `tenant_health` and is **never** treated as "the
  tenant was deleted" (rule #15) — only an explicit
  `DELETE /api/tenants/:id` removes a registry row.
- `wrangler.jsonc` — added a `triggers.crons` entry (`*/5 * * * *`
  by default; adjust to taste) that invokes the new `scheduled()`
  export in `worker/index.js`, which runs `runHealthChecks` inside
  `ctx.waitUntil()`.
- `POST /api/tenants/health-check-all` — an authenticated,
  on-demand version of the same sweep, for testing or for an admin
  who doesn't want to wait for the next tick. Logged to
  `lummet_audit_logs` (`action: "health_check_all"`) since it's an
  explicit admin action; the automatic cron ticks are not
  individually audit-logged — `tenant_health` is already the source
  of truth for reachability, and logging every scheduled tick for
  every tenant would mostly just be noise in the audit trail.
- The Health page (`/tenants/health`) gained a **Run all now**
  button that calls the on-demand endpoint and shows a summary
  before refreshing.
- Verified end-to-end against a fake D1 (no live tenant needed):
  a tenant with no configured credential correctly resolves to
  `Configuration Error`, and a disabled tenant resolves to
  `Disabled` without an outbound network call — both routed through
  the real `registry.js`/`client.js` code, not a reimplementation.

### Phase 8 — Audit logging (completeness)

Most of the audit trail already existed from earlier phases
(`lummet_audit_logs`, the Audit Logs page, and `logAudit()` calls on
every registry/CRUD/settings mutation). Phase 8 closes the
remaining gaps:

- **Admin login events are now audited.** Previously only
  registry/CRUD mutations were logged — a login, a failed login
  attempt, a bootstrap, or a logout never appeared in the trail.
  `POST /api/auth/{bootstrap,login,logout}` and the page-based
  `/login` form now all write to `lummet_audit_logs`
  (`action: "bootstrap" | "login" | "logout"`), including **failed**
  login attempts (the attempted email is recorded, never the
  password). This is on top of the existing `lummet_auth_attempts`
  rate-limiting table, which is unchanged.
- **Fixed a real bug found while wiring this up**: the page-based
  `/login` form handler called `parseForm(request)` (which consumes
  the request body as form data) and then also called
  `auth.login(request, env)`, which tried to read the same body
  again as JSON — a second read of an already-consumed `Request`
  body, which throws. Fixed by splitting `auth.js`'s `login()` into
  a thin request-parsing wrapper plus a reusable
  `authenticateAdmin(env, email, password, ipHash)` core; the page
  route now calls the core directly with the already-parsed form
  values instead of re-reading the request.
- **Retention**: `worker/cron.js` gained `pruneOldAuditLogs()`,
  which deletes `lummet_audit_logs` rows older than 180 days (only
  that table — never `tenant_health`, the registry, or any tenant's
  own data). It runs alongside the Phase 7 health-check sweep on
  the same Cron Trigger.
- **Filtering and pagination**: the Audit Logs page
  (`/platform/audit-logs`) now supports filtering by tenant, action,
  and success/failure, plus offset-based pagination (50 rows per
  page) instead of a fixed 200-row cap with no way to see older
  entries.
- Verified end-to-end against a fake D1: `bootstrapFirstAdmin` now
  returns the new admin's id via `INSERT ... RETURNING id` (a real
  D1-supported clause per Cloudflare's own docs), and the
  bootstrap → login → logout sequence was run against a mock
  `LUMMET_DB` to confirm `adminId` flows through correctly at every
  step.
- Confirmed no audit entry anywhere logs a password, a decrypted
  HMAC secret, or a KEK — `errorMessage` fields only ever contain
  error codes/reasons or an admin's own email.

This closes out all 8 phases of the master plan.

### Post-launch fix — orphaned tenants with no credential

Found in production: `createTenant()` wrote the `tenants` row
*before* generating the credential. If `CREDENTIAL_KEK` was missing
or invalid at that moment, credential generation threw — leaving a
tenant registered with **zero** rows in `tenant_api_credentials`.
Its detail page would show `Configuration Error` /
`no_active_credential` forever, with no way to fix it except
guessing to click "Rotate credential" (which had the identical bug:
it marked the old credential `rotated` *before* trying to issue the
new one, so a KEK failure mid-rotation could leave a tenant with
**zero active credentials**, not just its original one).

Fixed in both `createTenant()` and `rotateCredential()`: credential
material is now generated and validated *first* — if `CREDENTIAL_KEK`
is missing, the function fails immediately with a clear message
("check that CREDENTIAL_KEK is configured on this Worker") and
**no row is written at all** — no orphaned tenant, no zeroed-out
credential. The two writes (tenant + credential, or rotate-old +
insert-new) are also now sent as a single `D1.batch()` call rather
than two separate operations, so the database round-trip itself
can't split them either.

Verified with a functional test against a mocked D1: with no
`CREDENTIAL_KEK` set, `createTenant()` now leaves 0 tenant rows and
0 credential rows (previously: 1 orphaned tenant, 0 credentials);
with a KEK set, both rows are written together as before.

If you already have a tenant stuck in this state from before this
fix, click **Rotate credential** on its detail page (once
`CREDENTIAL_KEK` is confirmed set via `wrangler secret list`) — that
now safely issues a fresh, active credential for it.

### Phase 9 — Lummet's own CMS (homepage no longer hardcoded)

Everything on lummet.com itself — the homepage's copy, and pages,
authors, brand profiles, partners, updates, publications, and
advertisements — was previously either hardcoded HTML in `home.js`
or simply didn't exist as a manageable resource. Phase 9 adds a real
CMS for Lummet's own site, entirely separate from any tenant's
content:

- **New tables** (`migrations/0002_lummet_cms.sql`): `lummet_pages`,
  `lummet_authors`, `lummet_brands`, `lummet_partners`,
  `lummet_updates`, `lummet_publications`, `lummet_advertisements`,
  and `lummet_site_settings` (key/value, same shape as a tenant's own
  `settings` table).
- **`worker/cms-resources.js`** — the field/column contract for each
  resource (mirrors `resources.js`'s shape, but every one of these
  reads/writes this control plane's own D1 directly — there's no
  tenant HTTP call involved, unlike `resources.js`).
- **`worker/cms.js`** — the D1 CRUD layer: list/get/create/update/
  delete per resource, plus `getSiteSettings`/`setSiteSettings` for
  the homepage's editable copy, and `listPublished`/
  `getPublishedBySlug`/`listActiveAdsForPlacement` for what the
  public site actually reads (always filtered to
  published/active — a draft is never publicly reachable).
- **`worker/views/pages/cms.js`** — generic list/create/edit screens
  at `/cms/:resource`, reusing the same rich-text editor as the
  tenant CRUD screens (`renderRichTextField` from `crud.js`), plus a
  dedicated `/cms/settings` screen for the homepage's hero
  copy/CTAs/footer/contact email.
- **`home.js`'s homepage is now dynamic**: hero eyebrow/title/
  subtitle/CTA labels+links, footer text, and contact email all pull
  from `lummet_site_settings`, falling back to the original hardcoded
  copy if a field hasn't been set yet (so a fresh deploy, or one
  before migration 0002 has run, never renders broken/empty). Added
  a live **Updates** section and **Partners** section pulling
  published rows, and an ad-banner slot for the `homepage_banner`
  placement.
- **`/p/:slug`** — a new public route that renders a published
  `lummet_pages` row (e.g. an About page created from
  `/cms/pages/new`). Unpublished/draft pages 404.
- Nav gained a **"Lummet Site"** section: Pages, Authors, Brand
  profiles, Partners, Updates, Publications, Advertisements, and
  Homepage settings.

### Phase 10 — Lummet staff accounts & permissions

Before this phase, `lummet_admins` had exactly one usable role
(`master_admin`, set once at bootstrap) — there was no way to create
a second Lummet staff account at all, let alone scope what they could
do. Phase 10 adds real role-based access control for the control
plane itself:

- **New tables** (`migrations/0003_lummet_admin_rbac.sql`):
  `lummet_admins` gains `status` (active/disabled) and
  `must_change_password`; `lummet_admin_tenant_access` (which
  tenants a staff admin may switch to/act on at all);
  `lummet_admin_permissions` (per-admin resource/action grants,
  scoped by `area` — `tenant` for a tenant's own Content/System
  resources, or `cms` for Lummet's own CMS resources from Phase 9).
- **A super admin** (`role = "super_admin"`, or the legacy
  `"master_admin"` value from before this migration) bypasses every
  check — same pattern as a tenant's own `admin` role bypassing its
  permissions table. **Everyone else starts with zero access** —
  no tenants, no resources — until a super admin explicitly grants
  it. This is enforced by `worker/rbac.js` and checked at the top of
  every route handler that touches a tenant's content, Lummet's CMS,
  or the control plane's own registry/credentials — **not just by
  hiding the nav link**, since hiding a link never actually stops a
  direct request.
- **`/platform/admins`** (super-admin-only) — list staff accounts,
  create a new one (a random temporary password is generated and
  shown exactly once — there's no email-sending set up — and the new
  admin must change it on first login), toggle role/status, and a
  detail screen (`/platform/admins/:id`) with a tenant-access
  checklist and a full permission matrix (create/read/update/delete
  per resource, for both the `tenant` and `cms` areas).
- **Guardrails**: an admin can't change their own role, can't disable
  or delete themselves, and the last remaining super admin can't be
  demoted or deleted — there's always at least one account that can
  grant access to everyone else.
- **A disabled admin's existing sessions are cut immediately** (not
  just blocked at their next login attempt) — `getCurrentAdmin`
  deletes the session row the moment it sees `status = 'disabled'`.
- Nav now filters per-admin: `layout.js` loads the acting admin's
  full permission map once per request and only renders a link if
  they hold a `read` grant on that resource (super admins, and the
  "Dashboard" link, always render). The **Tenants** and **Platform**
  nav sections are super-admin-only outright, since they touch the
  control plane's own registry/credentials rather than a single
  tenant's content.
- Verified end-to-end against a real SQLite-backed mock D1 (not a
  reimplementation): bootstrap → create staff admin → confirm zero
  default access → grant tenant access + a `casinos.read` permission
  → confirm the grant is scoped to exactly that tenant/resource/
  action and doesn't leak to others → revoke → disable/re-enable
  login lockout → last-super-admin protections → CMS create/update/
  delete with slug-uniqueness and draft-vs-published visibility →
  homepage renders admin-edited copy with safe fallbacks → nav
  renders different links for a scoped staff admin vs. a super admin.
  41 assertions, all passing.

This closes out Phases 9 and 10 of the master plan.

## Deployment

See **DEPLOYMENT.md** in this same folder for the full, step-by-step
guide covering both the control plane and the tenant-side Super API
(including how they fit together, adding another tenant, day-to-day
operation, and rollback). This README covers what's built; that file
covers how to run it.
