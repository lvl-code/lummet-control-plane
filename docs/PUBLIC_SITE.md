# Lummet public website

The public site (lummet.com) is rendered by the control-plane Worker from its
own D1 database. There is no mock data, no placeholder copy and no hardcoded
content list in code: what a visitor sees is exactly the set of **published**
rows in the database.

## Layout of the code (mirrors the tenant's organisation)

## Routes

| URL | Source |
|---|---|
| `/` | `lummet_homepage_sections` (ordered), `lummet_site_settings` (hero), counts |
| `/brands`, `/brands/:slug` | `lummet_brands` |
| `/updates`, `/updates/:slug` | `lummet_updates` (paginated, newest first) |
| `/insights`, `/insights/:slug` | `lummet_publications` (filter `?type=`) |
| `/partners` | `lummet_partners` |
| `/authors/:slug` | `lummet_authors` + their published work |
| `/contact`, `/demo`, `/forms/:key` | `lummet_forms` + `lummet_form_fields`; POST stores into `lummet_inquiries` |
| `/about`, `/security`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/p/:slug` | `lummet_pages` |
| `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt` | generated |
| `/static/*` | `public/static/**` |

`/` still shows the authenticated dashboard to a signed-in admin.

## What is managed where (Dashboard -> Lummet Site)

| Screen | Controls |
|---|---|
| Homepage settings | site name/logo/accent colours, homepage `<title>` and description, canonical URL, hero copy and buttons, footer text, contact email, list-page titles and intros |
| Homepage sections | which sections appear, their order, `kind`, background, title/eyebrow/body, button |
| Features | the cards, steps, checklist items and AI-panel items inside sections (`group_key` <-> section `feature_group`) |
| FAQs | the FAQ section, and FAQPage structured data |
| Navigation links | header, header buttons and the three footer columns |
| Forms / Form fields | the contact and demo pages: titles, intro, button, success message, side panel, and every field (label, type, required, options, order) |
| Inquiries | submissions from the forms: read, set status (new / read / replied / spam / archived), add internal notes, delete |
| Interface text | every small label the site shows: button text, aria labels, empty states, form errors, footer column titles, type labels (`lummet_ui_strings`) |
| Brand profiles / Updates / Publications / Partners / Authors / Pages | the content pages, each with SEO title, description and social image |

Section kinds: `text`, `features`, `steps`, `checklist`, `panel`, `brands`,
`stats`, `updates`, `insights`, `partners`, `faq`, `cta`, `contact`.

## Nothing hardcoded: where each kind of text lives

| Kind of text | Lives in |
|---|---|
| Page and section copy, hero, footer text, list-page titles | `lummet_site_settings`, `lummet_homepage_sections`, `lummet_pages` |
| Cards, steps, checklist items, AI panel items | `lummet_features` |
| Navigation (header, buttons, footer columns) | `lummet_nav_links` |
| Contact / demo copy and every form field | `lummet_forms`, `lummet_form_fields` |
| Small interface text (labels, errors, empty states, ARIA) | `lummet_ui_strings` |
| Brands, updates, insights, partners, authors, FAQs | their own tables |

`test/forms.test.js` enforces this: it fails if a template contains literal
text outside `{{ }}`, if a template uses an interface key that is not seeded,
or if a client script contains a label. The only text outside the database is
the last-resort "Temporarily unavailable" page, which is shown when the
database itself cannot be read.

## Contact and demo forms

- **Submit flow:** POST to the same URL -> validate against the database field
  definitions -> store in `lummet_inquiries` -> 303 redirect to `?sent=1`
  (refreshing never resubmits). Errors re-render the form with the visitor's
  text kept and each message coming from `lummet_ui_strings`.
- **Spam and abuse controls, no third-party service and no cookies:** a hidden
  honeypot field (bots get a fake success and nothing is stored); a same-origin
  check on every POST (`Origin` / `Sec-Fetch-Site`); a per-visitor hourly limit
  (hashed IP; default 5, change with the `inquiry_rate_limit_per_hour` setting);
  size and length limits; select values must be one of the stored options.
- **Privacy:** only the submitted fields and a one-way IP hash are stored. Delete
  an inquiry from Lummet Site -> Inquiries when it is no longer needed.
- **Notification (optional):** `wrangler secret put INQUIRY_WEBHOOK_URL` with an
  `https://` Slack, Discord or other JSON webhook URL. Each new inquiry sends one
  short message. A failing webhook never loses the inquiry. Without it, check
  Lummet Site -> Inquiries (the app does not send email).
- **New forms:** Forms -> New (key `partners` -> `/forms/partners`), then add rows
  in Form fields with the same form key. A draft form returns 404.

## Footer at the bottom

`body` is a full-height flex column (`min-height: 100dvh`) and `<main>` has
`flex: 1 0 auto`, so the footer is flush with the bottom of the screen on a
short page and follows the content on a long one, at any screen size.

## The "real content" rules the code enforces

- Drafts are never queried by a public route.
- A section whose data source has no published rows is not rendered.
- A navigation link with `visible_when` = `has_partners` (etc.) hides until that content exists; `/#anchor` links hide when the section is not on the page.
- Every button and link is checked against what is published (`links.js`): a link to `/brands`, `/partners`, `/demo`, a page or a homepage anchor disappears when its destination would be empty, a 404, or absent from the page.
- The contact section links to the contact form when one is published; an email address is shown only if `contact_email` (or the `CONTACT_EMAIL` var) is set.
- The stats strip shows counts read from the database, never typed numbers.
- A brand without a `logo_url` shows an initials tile, not a fabricated logo.
- CMS URLs are restricted to `http(s)`, `mailto`, site-relative and `#`; CMS HTML is sanitized; accent colours are validated before reaching CSS.

## Caching

Rendered pages carry `Cache-Control: public, max-age=30, s-maxage=60,
stale-while-revalidate=300` and are stored with the Cache API, so D1 is not hit
on every view. A dashboard edit is live within about a minute. (The Cache API
only operates on custom domains, not `*.workers.dev`; there it renders each
request, which is still correct.)

## Content Security Policy

Public pages send `script-src 'self'`: there are no inline scripts, so a
stored-XSS payload in CMS content cannot execute even if a sanitizer gap is
found. Do not add inline `<script>` blocks to templates; add a file in
`public/static/js/` and reference it from `base.html`.

## Adding things

- **A new brand**: Brand profiles -> New. Upload the logo file to
  `public/static/images/brands/` (commit + deploy) and set Logo URL to
  `/static/images/brands/<file>`, or use a full `https://` URL.
- **A new homepage section**: Homepage sections -> New; pick a `kind`. For
  `features`/`steps`/`checklist`/`panel`, add Features rows with the same group.
- **A new page in the footer**: create the page in Pages, then add a
  Navigation link with Show when = `always` (an unpublished page 404s, so
  publish it first).
- **A new icon**: add its SVG path to `worker/public-site/icons.js` and to the
  Features `icon` list in `worker/cms-resources.js`.

## Tests

`npm test` runs `test/public-site.test.js` against the real migrations, the real
seed, the real templates and the real router (D1 -> `node:sqlite`, ASSETS ->
the `public/` folder).
